Iterate over all floating parameters, at each step adjusting just one parameter x in order
to minimize objective(x), the objective function (reduced chi-square plus penalties).
Continue until the fractional reduction in objective(x) due to a full pass through the
parameter list is less than term_prec.  Return the final value of the objective function.

Modified 2014 February 19 by CM:
    Allow for multiple optical scattering laws when setting the "vary_hapke" flag

Modified 2013 July 14 by CM:
    Implement the "term_maxiter" parameter

Modified 2012 July 5 by MCN and CM:
    Use the gethostname function rather than the HOST environment variable to get root's
        hostname
    List root's PID in addition to the hostname
    List the PID for each branch node, not just the hostname

Modified 2012 June 13 by CM:
    Implement "objfunc_start" parameter

Modified 2012 March 23 by CM:
    Implement Doppler scaling -- more particularly, simultaneous adjustment of shape/spin
        parameters and Doppler scale factors via the "vary_dopscale" parameter

Modified 2010 April 12 by CM:
    Bug fix: When fitting a size, shape, or spin parameter with the
         "vary_delcor0" parameter being used, call realize_delcor to reset
         the 0th-order delay correction polynomial coefficients to their
         saved values before calling vary_params.  (For infinitely fine
         model resolution and delay-Doppler resolution this wouldn't
         matter but in practice it does.)

Modified 2009 November 15 by CM:
    Fix printf statement with too many arguments

Modified 2009 July 5 by CM:
    Add "npar_update" parameter rather than hard-wiring an update (rewrite
        mod and obs files and display reduced chi2 and penalty functions)
        every 20th parameter adjustment

Modified 2009 April 3 by CM:
    If the model has illegal properties (e.g., negative ellipsoid diameters)
        then, for each type of problem, multiply the objective function not
        only by the "bad_objfactor" parameter but also by an additional
        factor that increases as the problem gets worse.  The
        "baddiam_logfactor" "badphoto_logfactor" "posbnd_logfactor"
        "badposet_logfactor" and "badradar_logfactor" parameters are the
        logarithms of the additional factors for the five possible problem
        types; the calc_fits routine computes the logarithms rather than the
        factors themselves so as to avoid floating-point overflow.
    Revise MPI_CALC so that root receives the "posbnd_logfactor" parameter
        from each branch node rather than the "posbnd" parameter:
        posbnd_logfactor > 0.0 if the model extends beyond the POS frame
        for any of the branch node's datasets.  If root sees that this
        value is > 0.0, it will set its "posbnd" flag and will increase the
        objective function accordingly.
    Revise MPI_CALC so that root receives the "badposet_logfactor"
        parameter from each branch node: badposet_logfactor > 0.0 if the
        model extends beyond the fit frame for any of the branch node's
        plane-of-sky datasets.  If root sees that this value is > 0.0, it
        will set its "badposet" flag and will increase the objective
        function accordingly.
    Revise MPI_CALC so that root receives the "badradar_logfactor"
        parameter from each branch node: badradar_logfactor > 0.0 if the
        model is too wide in delay-Doppler space for the program to
        construct some or all (delay-)Doppler fit frames.  If root sees
        that this value is > 0.0, it will set its "badradar" flag and will
        increase the objective function accordingly.
    For MPI_Recv calls, mpi_par[0] is no longer equal to the MPI action,
        since the message tag argument already serves that purpose (as of
        2008 April 10) -- so the other mpi_par elements are renumbered

Modified 2008 August 10 by CM:
    Never terminate the fit at the end of a partial iteration -- that is,
        after the first iteration of a fit where first_fitpar > 0

Modified 2008 July 11 by CM:
    Display the hostname even for single-processor fits

Modified 2008 April 10 by CM:
    For parallel-processing fits, display the hostname for each node
    Use message tag argument to MPI_Recv to identify the MPI action

Modified 2007 August 29 by CM:
    Implement the "avoid_badpos" parameter: if this parameter is turned on
        and the model extends beyond the POS frame and it is time to fit a
        size parameter, start by shrinking that size parameter until the
        model fits within the POS frame
    Implement the "bad_objfactor" parameter in routine objective: multiply
        the objective function by this factor for illegal photometric
        parameters, for tiny or negative ellipsoid diameters, and for
        models that extend beyond the plane-of-sky frame.  (Previously
        this factor was fixed at 2.0.)
    Rename MPI_TAG to MPI_TAG_1 to avoid name conflict with mpich headers

Modified 2007 August 16 by CM:
    Implement the "term_badmodel" parameter: If this parameter is turned on
        and, at the end of any fit iteration, the model ever extends beyond
        the POS frame OR has any illegal photometric parameters OR has any
        tiny or negative ellipsoid diameters, the fit is terminated.

Modified 2007 August 10 by CM:
    Eliminate unused variables

Modified 2006 December 20 by CM:
    Revise MPI_CALC so that root receives the "posbnd" parameter from each
        branch node, so that the objective function can be doubled if the
        model extends beyond the plane-of-sky frame for any datasets
    If the model extends beyond the plane-of-sky frame for any trial value
        of a parameter, evaluate the model for the best-fit parameter value
        to check whether or not it extends beyond the POS frame

Modified 2006 October 1 by CM:
    Add two new arguments to realize_delcor
    Add three new arguments to realize_photo
    Implement "vary_delcor0" "vary_radalb" and "vary_optalb" parameters
    Implement SIZEPAR parameters via the "newsize" variable

Modified 2005 June 27 by CM:
    Renamed "round" function to "iround" to avoid conflict

Modified 2005 March 17 by CM:
    For parallel processing, check that root is receiving the responses
        to the correct broadcast
    Root no longer needs to compute degrees of freedom or to receive
        dof values from branch nodes: Now they are computed in read_dat
    Degrees of freedom can now be floating-point rather than integer

Modified 2005 February 28 by CM:
    Add screen warnings if objective function has been doubled due to
        (a) tiny or negative ellipsoid diameters
        (b) illegal photometric parameters
        (c) model extending beyond the model POS frame
    Initialize the three parameters (baddiam, badphoto, posbnd) that
        flag these three problems in other routines (realize_mod,
        realize_photo, calc_fits) rather than in objective(x), so that
        these three parameters can be used for actions other than "fit"
    Rename DATAPAR to be DELCORPAR
    Add XYOFFPAR and implement the new realize_xyoff routine

Modified 2005 February 22 by CM:
    Move branch nodes' signoff statements from shape.c to here, so that
        they can appear in order

Modified 2005 February 13 by CM:
    Rename objective function "f(x)" to be "objective(x)"
    Only broadcast to branch nodes if there are any branch nodes
        (i.e., if mpi_nproc > 1)
    Broadcast the new MPI_DUMMYPAR signal to branch nodes before evaluating
        objective(0.0), the objective function for the existing model;
        this tells each branch node to point hotparam to a dummy variable
        rather than to a model parameter, so that the dummy variable will
        be set to 0.0 and the model will be unchanged.
    Broadcast the new MPI_CALFACT signal to branch nodes to get updated
        calibration factors before rewriting the obs file
    Root now realizes the model after setting a parameter to its best value
    Make sure that root and branch nodes update the model (i.e., that they
        call the calc_fits and chi2 routines) before rewriting the mod and
        obs files and before calling routine show_deldoplim
    Avoid unnecessary model realizations for root by allowing newshape,
        newspin, newphoto, and newdelcor to be 0, not always 1 as before
    Move MPI_DONE broadcast to here from shape.c

Modified 2005 January 25 by CM:
    Eliminated unused variable

Modified 2005 January 10 by CM:
    When fitting using parallel processing, ping all of the branch nodes
        and inform the user that they're active

Modified 2004 October 29 by CM:
    Add "first_fitpar" parameter so that a fit can be started (or resumed)
        at some parameter (counting from 0) other than the first parameter

Modified 2004 October 10 by CM:
    Fix chi-square display at start of each iteration and at the
        end of the fit by calling realize_mod, realize_spin, realize_photo,
        realize_delcor, and calc_fits before calling chi2

Modified 2004 August 13 by CM:
    Call modified minimum search routine brent_abs rather than brent
        so that absolute fitting tolerances can be specified

Modified 2004 May 21 by CM:
    Display the final values of the individual penalty functions

Modified 2004 April 3 by CM:
    Add the "list_breakdown" argument to routine chi2 so that we can
        display the chi2 breakdown by data type (Doppler, delay-Doppler,
        POS, lightcurves) at the start of each fit iteration and at
        the end of the fit

Modified 2004 February 26 by CM:
    realize_photo now takes two arguments rather than one

Modified 2003 April 26 by CM:
    Added "show_deldoplim" call at the end of each fit iteration,
        to check for overly tight data vignetting

Modified 2003 April 23 by CM:
    Implemented '=' state for delay correction polynomial coefficients
        via the "realize_delcor" routine

Modified 2003 April 17 by CM:
    Added "baddiam" parameter to function f so that the objective
        function is doubled if an ellipsoid component has a tiny or
        negative diameter

Modified 2003 April 2 by CM:
    In function f (which computes reduced-chi-squared-plus-penalties),
        moved call to "penalties" from before spar->showstate is set
        to after.
    Values of reduced chi-squared and of the various penalties are
        printed to the screen after every 20th parameter adjustment.
        To be precise, they're printed at the very first call to f when
        adjusting parameter 21, 41, 61, etc.  This call is made within
        function bestfit by minimum-bracketing function mnbrak;
        it corresponds to the *unadjusted* value of parameter 21 (or 41
        or ...), which is what we want.
    Until now, the individual penalty values were being printed on the
 *second* call to f, also made by mnbrak but with parameter 21
        incremented by the relevant initial step size (e.g., length_step).
        Hence these printed values were irrelevant and misleadingly large.
        Moving the call to "penalties" later in the code fixes the problem.
