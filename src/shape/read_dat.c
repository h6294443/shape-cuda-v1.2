Reads file describing observed data.

Modified 2016 July 7 by Matt Engels:
	Adapted for use in shape-cuda.

Modified 2016 February 24 by CM:
    Bug fix in the "read_poset" routine: pixel mask arrays were being read in with rows
        and column switched, causing the program to crash

Modified 2015 June 10 by CM:
    Implement smearing for the "fit" and "write" actions by reading number of views per
        frame (or lightcurve point), view interval, and smearing mode for all datasets

Modified 2014 March 12 by CM:
    Pass the "mod" argument to read_dat so we can check that the scattering law specified
        for each dataset is within legal bounds

Modified 2014 February 12 by CM:
    Implement multiple radar and optical scattering laws

Modified 2013 June 17 by CM:
    Check that pixel-weighting masks contain the expected number of entries and quit with
        an informative error message if they don't; this way the program doesn't choke if
        you add or remove datasets and forget to rename the mask files accordingly

Modified 2013 April 24 by CM:
    Adjust input filenames for pixel-weighting masks so they are in alphanumeric order if
        > 100 per dataset

Modified 2012 March 24 by CM:
    In read_deldop and read_doppler, read "dopscale" parameter and initialize
        "dopscale_save" for each (delay-)Doppler dataset
    Call realize_dopscale routine to initialize Doppler scaling factors (including those
        with the '=' state)

Modified 2011 August 11 by CM:
    Initialize quantities related to spin impulses

Modified 2010 April 27 by CM:
    In read_deldop, check return value of "system" commands in order to
        avoid compilation warnings

Modified 2009 March 24 by CM:
    In read_lghtcrv, store the values that are (potentially) listed in the
        obs file for calculated lightcurve points: number of points,
        JD start time, JD stop time, and JD interval

Modified 2008 August 19 by CM:
    Save the row and column limits within the unvignetted image of
        vignetted images, and similarly for vignetted spectra

Modified 2007 October 22 by CM:
    Fix bug in read_deldop: DC bin must be adjusted for vignetted images

Modified 2007 August 31 by CM:
    Implement "maskdir" parameter
    In read_deldop, use tempname function to get unique temporary filenames
        for zipped and unzipped delay-Doppler datafiles rather than using
        the fixed names /tmp/deldop.dat.gz and /tmp/deldop.dat

Modified 2007 August 10 by CM:
    Eliminate unused variable

Modified 2007 August 4 by CM:
    In read_lghtcrv, check that the number of observed lightcurve points is
        equal to what the obs file claims it to be

Modified 2007 July 23 by CM:
    Add body, bodyill, comp, and compill matrices to POS frames

Modified 2007 January 6 by CM:
    In read_lghtcrv, allocate memory for rotation phases at calculated
        epochs (rotphase_calc) and at observation epochs (rotphase_obs)

Modified 2006 October 1 by CM:
    Add two new arguments to realize_delcor
    In read_deldop and read_doppler, initialize "delcor0_save" for each
        delay correction polynomial
    Compute three sums of weights for use by the vary_params routine
    In read_lghtcrv, convert input magnitudes and magnitude errors to
        intensities (relative to solar intensity) and intensity errors

Modified 2006 June 21 by CM:
    In read_deldop, changed delres to del_per_pixel and dopres to
        dop_per_pixel, and improved comments
    In read_doppler, changed dopres to dop_per_bin and improved comments
    In read_poset, changed angres to angle_per_pixel and and res to
        km_per_pixel, and improved comments
    For POS renderings, changed res to km_per_pixel

Modified 2006 June 18 by CM:
    Implement "mask" pixel-weighting flag for delay-Doppler, Doppler, and
        plane-of-sky frames
    Allow each delay-Doppler frame within a dataset to have different
        dimensions after vignetting
    Allow each Doppler frame within a dataset to have different
        dimensions after vignetting
    Allow plane-of-sky frames to be rectangular and to have any number
        of pixels (not just an odd number) per side
    Read plane-of-sky frames from FITS files rather than from pgm files
    Eliminate range datasets

Modified 2005 November 18 by MCN:
    Change nlooks (# of looks) from integer to floating-point, to handle
        zero-filled data

Modified 2005 July 21 by CM:
    Fully implement "local" value for "pos_scope" parameter:
        Each delay-Doppler frame, Doppler frame, range frame, plane-of-sky
        data frame, and calculated lightcurve point has separate memory
        allocated for its own model POS frame

Modified 2005 July 1 by CM:
    Fix bug in read_lghtcrv: When assigning evenly spaced calculation
        epochs, the last epoch was later than the specified stop epoch

Modified 2005 June 20 by JLM & CM:
    Create new routines to read delay-Doppler and Doppler datafiles in
        ASCII, rdf, FITS, or binary format.  Byte-swapping is done
        automatically if needed.

Modified 2005 April 25 by CM:
    Compute variance of chi2 estimate

Modified 2005 March 10 by CM:
    Compute degrees of freedom here rather than in routine chi2, so that
        it only needs to be done once for a fit rather than repeatedl;
    Add "dof" argument to read_deldop, read_doppler, read_poset,
        read_lghtcrv, and read_range to enable this change
    Allow weights (and hence degrees of freedom) to be floating-point
        rather than integer

Modified 2005 March 6 by CM:
    For plane-of-sky datasets, eliminate "calfact" from the obs file;
        instead, for each frame, force the calibration factor to float
        and assign it an initial dummy value

Modified 2005 March 1 by CM:
    Rename some "sdev" and "var" values to "oneovervar" (1/variance)
    For plane-of-sky datasets, eliminate "sdev" and add "northangle"
        for each frame
    Fix bug: the number of floating parameters (npar) was too large
        because floating plane-of-sky calibration factors were being
        included
    Add call to new realize_xyoff routine

Modified 2005 January 25 by CM:
    Take care of unused and uninitialized variables

Modified 2005 January 21 by CM:
    Allocate memory for POS images (sky renderings) for POS and range
        datasets
    Permit one-way light-time corrections for POS and range datasets
    For POS and range datasets, pass "frame[i].oe" rather than
        "frame[i].fit.oe" to ephem2mat; for POS datasets, pass
        "frame[i].se" rather than "frame[i].fit.se" to ephem2mat
    Eliminate null processing block for POS and range datasets when the
        "pos_scope" parameter is set to "local"
    Assign solar phase angles and solar azimuth angles for POS datasets
    Convert POS angular resolution from arcseconds to radians

Modified 2005 January 13 by CM:
    Always read the "mpi node" value for each dataset in the obs file, but
        only pay attention to it if the "read_node" parameter is set to 1.
        Before this it was only read if read_node = 1, meaning that lines
        had to be added to or deleted from the obs file depending on the
        value of this parameter.
    If the mpi node for a given dataset is input as a negative number,
        assign that dataset to the next processing node, even if read_node
        is set to 1.  This reproduces the behavior that one would obtain
        by setting read_node = 0, except that one can choose it for only a
        subset of the datasets if desired.
    For parallel processing, data should only be read by the appropriate
        node.  (Until now this was being done only for delay-Doppler and
        lightcurve datasets.)
    For parallel processing, suppress most screen output for nodes
        other than root
    For parallel processing, show which node is assigned to which dataset
    Added "s" (set number) argument to read_poset and read_range routines

Modified 2004 August 6 by CM:
    Shift all Euler angle offsets to the range (-180, +180] degrees

Modified 2004 July 26 by CM:
    For Doppler and delay-Doppler frames, don't allow constant
        calibration factors which are <= 0.0
    Added "s" (set number) argument to read_doppler routine

Modified 2004 April 9 by CM:
    Compute solar azimuth angles (N -> E in POS) for lightcurve datasets

Modified 2004 March 22 by CM:
    For lightcurve points, save the orbital (plane-of-sky) contribution
        to the apparent spin vector

Modified 2004 March 13 by CM:
    For lightcurve datasets, add option to calculate model magnitudes
        at the same epochs for which observations are available;
        denote this in the obs file by specifying "-1" as the number of
        points at which to calculate, and don't actually list any
        calculation epochs below that line.  Repeated observation epochs
        (presumably due to observations at multiple observatories on the
        same night) are weeded out.
    For lightcurve datasets with calculation epochs explicitly listed
        or else specified via start/stop/interval, validate that the
        epochs are in increasing order with no repeated values.

Modified 2004 February 13 by CM:
    Removed "sdev" argument to routine gamma_trans
    Replaced LTC variable by perform_ltc parameter for computing
        1-way light-time correction
    Compute solar phase angles for lightcurve datasets

Modified 2003 December 12 by CM:
    Stop program if a Doppler dataset uses the 'f' state for its
        zeroth-order delay polynomial coefficient

Modified 2003 April 24 by CM:
    Move "delcom" from delay-Doppler datasets to individual frames
    Add "weight" to delay-Doppler, Doppler, POS, and range frames
        and to lightcurve datasets
    Integrate the extra delay-Doppler parameters added April 15 with
        two existing lines in the datafile

Modified 2003 April 23 by CM:
    Implement '=' state for delay correction polynomial coefficients:
        now call "realize_delcor" rather than directly calling
        "deldopoffs" or "dopoffs"

Modified 2003 April 15 by CM:
    Read an extra line of delay-Doppler information
        (e.g., # samples per baud)

          renderings are set up: shape needs to resample POS renderings to get
          plane-of-sky fit images, and it can handle rotations of +/- northangle
          when it resamples but it can't handle axis flipping. */
