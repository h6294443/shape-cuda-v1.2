This routine evolves a spin state from the initial spin epoch to a desired final time by
integrating Euler's equations and, if specified, applying one or more spin impulses at
various epochs along the way.  Input includes a structure of type spin_t giving initial
conditions for the model's spin state (in ecliptic coordinates); an n-length vector of
times t to integrate to; the spin impulses to be applied at those times, impulse[n][3],
a matrix listing instantaneous increments to the spin vector components as expressed in
body-fixed coordinates; and the "pa" and "method" flags that are described below.  The
initial impulse (impulse[0][*]) will always be zero, and the final one will usually be
zero as well, unless by coincidence the final time t[n-1] precisely corresponds to the
epoch at which a spin impulse is to be applied.

The evolution must be done in steps if spin impulses are being applied at one or more
times between t[0] (which is always the initial spin epoch spin.t0) and final time t[n-1].
The routine takes the initial spin state and evolves it from t[0] to t[1]; then the spin
impulse at t[1] (= impulse[1][*]) is added to the evolved spin vector (expressed in
body-fixed coordinates); then this new spin state is evolved from t[1] to t[2]; then the
second spin impulse is added to the spin vector output by that integration; and so on
until we reach the desired epoch t[n-1].  If t[n-1] < t[0] then we are integrating
backwards in time and the spin impulses are negated by the realize_spin routine,
so that inteuler effectively subtracts them from the spin vector rather than adding them.

The "pa" flag is true if the model is in a principal-axis rotation state, in which case
the spin state is evolved using simple arithmetic rather than by integrating Euler's
equations.  The "method" flag selects the integration method for non-principal-axis (NPA)
rotation:

    method = BRUTE     : brute-force numerical integration from t[0] to t[n-1]
           = PERIODIC  : numerical integration exploiting periodicity of the spin vector

Output is the spin vector w[3] (in body-fixed coordinates) at time t[n] and also the
matrix m[3][3] that transforms from ecliptic to body-fixed coordinates at time t[n-1].

    Included libration along the z direction in the spin

Modified 2011 August 23 by CM:
    When integrating Euler's equations for an NPA rotator, pass the "int_abstol"
        parameter to the Numerical Recipes in C "odeint" routine rather than using
        a hard-wired tolerance
    When integrating Euler's equations for an NPA rotator, scale the spin vector
        components by wscale, the magnitude of the initial spin vector, so that all 12
        variables being solved for (3 for w, 9 for m) are of order unity.  Until now
        the solution for m was somewhat less accurate than that for w.  (The elegant
        thing would be to use dimensionless time t' = wscale*t but I won't bother.)
    Implement spin impulses.  This entails changing the arguments and evolving the spin
        state in multiple steps.  For NPA rotators it also entails changing the intnpa1
        and intnpa2 routines so that they (a) don't assume that the integration starts at
        initial spin epoch spin.t0 with spin state given by spin.angle and spin.omega,
        and (b) use "w" and "m" as input parameters (initial spin vector and angular
        orientation) as well as output parameters.
