Compute the penalty functions for all penalties being applied to this model

Modified 2014 February 15 by CM:
    Adjust several penalty functions to accommodate multiple radar and optical
        scattering laws within a mod file

Modified 2013 July 6 by CM:
    Add the "pa3tilt" penalty

Modified 2011 September 2 by CM:
    Add the "harmlambert" and "inholambert" cases for the "optalbdel" and "optalbvar"
        penalties

Modified 2011 August 22 by CM:
    Add the "impulse" penalty

Modified 2010 August 31 by CM:
    Fix bug in the "noncosine" penalty: forgot to assign value to n

Modified 2010 June 1 by CM:
    Revise the "rdev" and "maxrdev" penalties now that the "scalefactor"
        parameter is a 3-component vector rather than a scalar

Modified 2010 May 12 by CM:
    Revise the "bifurcation" penalty so that it's not sensitive to the
        exact positions of vertices that lie near zone boundaries

Modified 2010 April 27 by CM:
    Add the "noncosine" and "bifurcation" penalties

Modified 2009 November 15 by CM:
    Remove unused variable

Modified 2009 August 2 by CM:
    Adjust the nonsmooth and concavity penalties to pay attention to the
        "act" (active) flags of model sides rather than of model facets

Modified 2009 July 2 by CM:
    For various penalties, only sum over active facets/vertices/sides,
        thus excluding interior regions for multiple-component models
    For the "rdev" "maxrdev" and "maxellipdev" penalties, scale to the
        overall model's effective radius, not to the effective radius for
        each component
    For the "maxellipdev" penalty, compute deviations from the overall
        model's DEEVE, not from each component's DEEVE

Modified 2007 February 21 by CM:
    Add the "maxrdev" and "maxellipdev" penalties
    Fix bugs in "rdev" penalty, and change this penalty so that each
        vertex deviation is normalized to the effective radius of that
        component
    Change the "comdev" penalty so that the COM displacement is normalized
        to the model's effective radius

Modified 2005 September 7 by CM:
    Add the "harmlommel" "harmhapke" and "harmkaas" cases for the
        "optalbdel" and "optalbvar" penalties
    Add the "harmhapke" case for the "thetadel" and "thetavar" penalties
    Add the "harmcosine" case for the "radalbdel" "radalbvar" "rad_c_del"
        and "rad_c_var" penalties

Modified 2005 August 10 by CM:
    Add the "inhokaas" case for the "optalbdel" and "optalbvar" penalties

Modified 2005 July 20 by CM:
    Add the "thetadel" penalty for the "inhohapke" optical scattering law
    Add four penalties for the "inhocosine" radar scattering law:
        "radalbdel" "radalbvar" "rad_c_del" "rad_c_var"
    Don't display "changed negative penalty to 0.0" messages at all, since
        these situations are always due to slight roundoff error

Modified 2005 July 7 by CM:
    Don't display "changed negative penalty to 0.0" messages to the screen
        unless the par->showstate flag is turned on

Modified 2005 July 4 by CM:
    Adjust the structure for the "inholommel" optical scattering law
    Enable the "optalbdel" penalty for the "inhohapke" optical scattering
        law
    Protect against division by zero for "rdev" penalty

Modified 2005 March 8 by CM:
    Fix bug with negative penalty weights

Modified 2005 February 28 by CM:
    Eliminate checks that photometric parameters are valid, since these
        checks are now performed in routine realize_photo

Modified 2005 January 25 by CM:
    Initialize variable to avoid compilation warning

Modified 2004 May 4 by CM:
    Added "flattening" penalty

Modified 2004 April 25 by CM:
    Added "inertiadev_uni" and "nonpa_uni" penalties for PA rotators

Modified 2003 April 21 by CM:
    Added comments
    Protected against division by zero (for negative penalty weights)

Modified 2003 April 17 by CM:
    Removed the large code block for computing 0th, 1st, and 2nd-order
        moments, partly because it wasn't executed if none of the three
        penalties VOLUME and COMDEV and INERTIADEV were used, partly
        because it would be nice to know volumes and COM displacements
        and inertia tensors even when there's no need to evaluate
        penalties.  (Added this same code to function realize_mod.)

            divide this vector by the square root of the sum of squares
            of all nine tensor elements.  (The latter quantity appears as
            "sqrt(b)" below, and is invariant under rotation -- in
            particular, under transformation to principal-axis coordinates.)
            The resulting vector has unit length if the inertia tensor is
            diagonal, but is shorter otherwise.

            Create a second vector -- this one certainly a unit vector --
            by carrying out the same procedure with the three principal
            moments of inertia, treating them as the diagonal elements of
            a 3x3 diagonal matrix.  Here we use the three "spin.inertia"
            parameters listed in the "spin" section of the model file,
            NOT the principal moments we would obtain by diagonalizing the
            inertia tensor.  Since the inertia tensor was computed assuming
            uniform density, these two sets of principal moments will differ
            if the density is nonuniform.

            The resulting penalty function is zero iff these two vectors are
            identical -- that is, iff the inertia tensor is diagonal AND the
            model density is uniform.  It is positive for any other case.
            Hence this penalty pushes the model towards uniform density with
            principal axes remaining close to the body-coordinate axes.

            Note that this penalty is confined to the range [0, 2].

            Note also that the three "spin.inertia" moments are the parameters
            used in Euler's equations for evolving the spin state of NPA
            rotators.  The "inertiadev" penalty, then, is the only link between
